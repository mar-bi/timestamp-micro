Timestamp Microservice Project
------------

is a fullstack JavaScript application built using: 
- Node.js
- Express.js

It processes a querystring supplied by a user and returns a JSON response according to the string value. If the string was a unix timestamp or a natural language date, it returns both the unix timestamp and the natural language date. If it was not, it returns **null** for both values.
